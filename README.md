## Introduction

Avila bible is one of the largest and most spectacular codices in the Spanish National Library. The ornamentation features contrasting Italian and Spanish styles. The Italian decoration depicts the authors of the books and contains numerous capitals, either illuminated or coloured in red, blue, yellow and dark green on lighter backgrounds in the same tone. The colours change in the Spanish decoration, which also has exceptional intertwined initials and whole-page figurative illustrations of subjects such as Noah's Ark, the symbols of the evangelists and scenes from the life of Christ.
